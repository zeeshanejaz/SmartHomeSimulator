#Smart Home Simulator

This project is inspired by one of my most favourite shows the **Big Bang Theory**, to be specific, the lamp switch gag.

> Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp.

So I decided to make a visual simulator for a course on UML / OOP and C\++. Usually, courses like these are dull and full information dump, which students find boring can't keep up with. Student at this stage have little C/C++ background to make anything interesting by themselves, so why not make it easy for them. Having an interesting example to practice on will give them a huge moral boost.

## Objective
The objective of this project to give UML/OOP and C\++ beginners an interesting yet easy example to grasp the core ideas. We assume that students will have basic C\++ skills like making a program, compilation, header files, variables, loops, accepting using inputs and showing outputs etc. This project will give student a rich playground to practice concepts like inheritence, polymorphism, overloading, composition and aggregation etc.
